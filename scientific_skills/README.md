# :mortar_board: Scientific skills

If you aim at writing a scientific thesis (Bachelor, Master, PhD), or publish scientific papers at conferences or journals, then all the "doing" skills are not enough.
You should also acquire the following skills.


### :books: Literature research

#### Scientifically dealing with literature

In your studies so far, chances are that your literature resources were spoon-fed to you in the form of PowerPoint slides or lecture scripts.
When you start doing your own research, you have to find, manage, evaluate, and cite the relevant literature on your own.
You might be wondering which types of sources can, and if so, should be cited in a thesis in which way? What are the relevant differences between conference papers, journal articles, preprints, books, book chapters, other theses, news articles, blog entries, patents, repository READMEs, project deliverables etc.?

The booklet [How to use, cite and reference literature effectively](https://wedc-knowledge.lboro.ac.uk/details.html?id=19409) by Loughborough University might be a great help for scientifically dealing with literature.
#### Search techniques

Some literature search techniques can reduce the chance of missing out important related work:
- **Keyword search**: Use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) with well-chosen search strings
  - use operators such as `AND` and `OR` and `"quotation marks"` to better express what you are looking for
  - for more information, see e.g. [How to use Google Scholar](https://www.wur.nl/en/article/How-to-use-Google-Scholar.htm) by Wageningen University
- **Snowballing search** (see e.g. [Guidelines for Snowballing in Systematic Literature
Studies and a Replication in Software Engineering](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2601248.2601268)):
  - The relevant literature that you already know is your start set
  - In iterations, perform:
    - forward snowballing: use the "Cited by" feature of Google Scholar to search through all works that have cited your already known relevant literature
    - backward snowballing: search through the bibliographies of your relevant literature

In practice, the time for literature research in your thesis might be too short to be able to rigorously apply these search techniques, but being aware of them hopefully helps you to bring some structure and objectivity into the otherwise pretty subjective search process.

#### Literature management tools

You should use a proper software to manage all your PDFs. These tools generate your list of references as needed by Word or Latex. Common choices are:
| Tool | Business model | Fidelity | Word/Latex | Supported Platforms |
| ---  | ---            | ---------| ---        | --------------      |
| [Citavi](https://www.citavi.com/de) | proprietary (available through RWTH) | advanced | Word and Latex | Web version; Desktop version for Windows |
| [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/) | open-source | bare-bones | mostly Latex | Desktop versions for all platforms |

Other choices are [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager/), [Endnote](https://endnote.com/), or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).



### :brain: Critical and scientific reasoning

You might program awesome systems, export impressive figures, write in English like a native speaker, and claim to have developed or found out something outstanding.
However, the readers of your paper will only comprehend that and believe you if your claims are backed up by a clear logical argumentation.

I would like to provide more material about this, but for now, can only provide this ad-hoc-searched list. Contributions are welcome.
| Topic | Resource Description |
| ---- | --------  |
| [Induction vs. deduction](https://conjointly.com/kb/deduction-and-induction/) | Website |
| Distinguishing [correlation and causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation) in complicated situations] | Wikipedia page |
| [SPRO 100: Scientific Reasoning](https://lpsonline.sas.upenn.edu/academics/courses/spro-100-scientific-reasoning) | MOOC by UPenn |



###  :pencil: Scientific writing

Which wording is appropriate in a thesis? How to describe the state of the art? How to describe your own methods and results? Which sort of figures can support your message?

In your thesis, you are expected to demonstrate scientific writing skills no matter whether you have had formal education about it or not. To prepare for this, I can personally recommend:
- [Scientific Writing for Bachelor and Master Candidates](https://www.sz.rwth-aachen.de/cms/SZ/Schreibzentrum/Veranstaltungen/~lkmeu/Kurse-auf-Englisch/?lidx=1) (elective course of RWTH Aachen Language Center)
- [English for Writing Research Papers](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9781441979223) (Textbook)

### :microscope: Understanding how science is organized

Which respective roles do industry and academia play in R&D? Are the goals of fundamental and applied research different? Why is my individual research project funded at all? In applied research, where is the line between creation of public knowledge and regional economic support?

In the field of automated driving, dealing with these questions might give you more purpose and orientation about what you are doing within the greater context of society.
Contributions about further material on this are welcome!

Somewhat related to this, RWTH has introduced the online course "[Scientific Integrity](https://www.gdi.rwth-aachen.de/cms/GDI/Das-Lehr-und-Forschungsgebiet/Aktuelle-Meldungen/~kjvtr/Wissenschaftliche-Integritaet/?lidx=1)". It appears to be covering the [Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice. Code of Conduct](https://zenodo.org/record/3923602#.YGgx_edCRPY) of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

### :shit: Recognizing pseudo-science

If common guidelines for good research practice are not followed, so-called Bullshit can happen. There has been a pretty informative course called [Calling Bullshit](https://www.callingbullshit.org/) at the University of Washington dealing with precisely this, and its lectures are available on YouTube.

For example, a "journal" might tell you on LinkedIn that they are interested in publishing your Bachelor's thesis as a scientific article for a given publishing fee. You might feel honored, but most probably, this is a predatory journal that is only interested in your money.
