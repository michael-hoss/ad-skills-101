# :racing_car: Automated driving skills

This page is rather short because this repository mostly aims at teaching you the *prerequisites* for automated driving - but not automated driving itself.

## General

Ideally, you participate in ika's courses
- [Automotive Engineering IV - Automated Driving](https://www.ika.rwth-aachen.de/en/education/students/lectures/3038-automotive-engineering-iv.html)
- [Self-Driving Lab II - Algorithms](https://www.ika.rwth-aachen.de/en/education/students/lectures/2368-self-driving-lab-2-algorithms.html)

to acquire skills and knowledge specific to automated driving itself.

## Function development

Check out this material to quickly get into a sub-topic of automated driving:

Contributions about *public* and *beginner-friendly* material on the follwing sub-topics are welcome!

| Topic | Resource | Resource description |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| Sensors |        |      |
| Perception |     |     |
| Localization |   |      |
| Prediction |    |
| Planning |  |
| Vehicle control |   |
| Actuators |    |
| V2X |  |

## Machine learning
Machine Learning deserves a separate section here because it has found its way into many sub-fields of automated driving, mostly perception, prediction, planning, and control.

Contributions about the best material for engineers to get started with ML are welcome.

## Safety assurance & impact assessment

Furthermore, safety assurance and impact assessment are crucial for actually getting automated vehicles on the road.

There was a free MOOC that contained safety assurance of AD.
