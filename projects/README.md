# Projects to work on

Studying is most effective if you have a goal mind. This goal could be building your own automated vehicle with your fellow students, acquiring the needed skills for a thesis or internship, or contributing to an open source driving function.


## üéì Student theses or student research assistant jobs

Institutes of RWTH Aachen University that work on automated driving or autonomous mobile robotics:

- [ika - Research Area Vehicle Intelligence & Automated Driving](https://www.ika.rwth-aachen.de/en/education/students/student-theses/recent-topics/automated-driving-department.html) (workplace of this repository's maintainer)
- [i11 - Cyber-Physical Mobility Group](https://www.embedded.rwth-aachen.de/doku.php?id=en:forschung:mobility)
- [irt - Group Mobility](https://www.irt.rwth-aachen.de/cms/IRT/Forschung/~izpn/Mobilitaet/?lidx=1) and [Group Navigation Solutions](https://www.irt.rwth-aachen.de/cms/IRT/Forschung/~izql/Navigationsloesungen/lidx/1/)
- [Cybernetics Lab - Mobile Robotics](https://cybernetics-lab.de/en/research-groups/mobilerob)
- [IGMR - Robotics and Mechatronics](https://www.igmr.rwth-aachen.de/index.php/de/rob)
- [SE - Team Automotive](https://www.se-rwth.de/teams/automotive/)
- Contributions about further research activities at RWTH are welcome.

If you find a topic you could work on at an institute's website, but there is no related job or thesis advertisement, it is usually a good idea to write a speculative application with at least your CV and transcript of records.

Furthermore, Fachschaft Maschinenbau offers a [platform for student jobs and theses](https://www.fsmb.rwth-aachen.de/jobs/), but not all jobs advertised at the institutes' websites are also listed there.


## üëî Internships and working student jobs

Internships and working student jobs are possible at:
- Companies who build entire automated driving systems
- Vehicle OEMs
- Suppliers - large and small
- Engineering service providers
- Research institutions (research internships)

## üë®‚Äçüéì üë©‚Äçüéì Student associations

Student associations of RWTH Aachen University that work on automated driving or autonomous mobile robotics:
- [Ecurie Aix](https://ecurie-aix.de/), the formula student driverless team
- [Team Galaxis](http://galaxis.rwth-aachen.de/), the CaroloCup team
- [Roboterclub Aachen](https://www.roboterclub.rwth-aachen.de/), participating in the Eurobot Robotics Competition
- [Team Sonnenwagen](https://www.sonnenwagen.org/en/), building a solar-powered vehicle


There is also an overview site of [competitions that RWTH teams participate in](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/Studium/Im-Studium/Engagement-Freizeit/~pdrx/Studentische-Wettbewerbe/lidx/1/).


## :octocat: Open source repositories

The following open source repositories might be interesting to contribute to as a student.

As a beginner, you will hardly understand what these projects do and how they are developed, but if you actively use one of them for 1 or 2 years and acquire the skills described here, then you might be able to contribute something back.

| Open-source project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Autoware.AI](https://github.com/Autoware-AI) | an automated driving function based on ROS1 |
| [Autoware.Auto](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto)  | an automated driving function based on ROS2 |
| [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo) | another automated driving function |
| [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) | an automated driving simulation engine |
| [ROS](https://github.com/ros2) | the most well-known software framework for automated driving R&D |
| [Lanelet2](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2) | an HD map format and framework for automated driving |
