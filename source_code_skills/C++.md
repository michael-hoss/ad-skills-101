# C++ 

## Compile your code

Before you forget it: C++ is a *compiled* language! This means changes to your source code have NO effect on the execution of your program unless you 
- save your source code files
- build (preprocess, compile, and link) your code to an executable

## A hard language worth learning

In traditional C++, you have to do many things on your own, such as 
- taking care of RAM memory: allocating and freeing memory for your variables; using the memory addresses of variables instead of the variables themselves
- deciding whether data in your memory should be duplicated or referenced when you use it in different functions
- the building process from source code to an executable 

Related to this, there is much complicated syntax with operators like `*&[]->`. This might sound discouraging, but the good news is: 
- With the knowledge and skills from C++
  - you can learn other languages much easier.
  - you can understand what is happening under the hood in other languages that hide away all these complicated concepts from you.
- Modern C++ is already much easier to write than traditional C++!
  -  While traditional C++, e.g. C++03 (version number always corresponds to the year, 2011) was pretty bare-bones, in C++11, C++14, C++17 and C++20, much beginner-friends syntax was introduced that makes your code shorter and easier to write, read, and understand.
