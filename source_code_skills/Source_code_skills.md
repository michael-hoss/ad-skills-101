# Source code skills

Universities usually teach at least one higher-level programming language to technical students. Try to take as much as possible from that university course.

The most essential programming languages for automated driving are:

| Language (with link to subpage)  | Difficulty | Application |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| [**C++**](C++.md)     | hard (but worth it!)  | manually written code whose execution must be as fast as possible |
| [**Python**](Python.md)  | easy (but also worth it!) | training neural networks, prototyping, and many other things |



### Learn one language properly first

Make sure to **start with only one language, but learn that language in depth**. Choose the language you need most for reaching your next goal.
You can learn the other language later on.

### Source code topics to cover in any language

No matter which languge you learn, you should cover 
- basic syntax like functions, loops, if-else, switch case etc.
- reading and writing from files and from the command line
- object-oriented design
- the standard library and other most common libraries
- common data structures like arrays, lists, maps/dictionaries
- graphical user interfaces


### How to google properly

Also experienced programmers don't hesitate to google all kinds of programming issues.
This workflow could help you:

- You are programming
- You get stuck, e.g.
  - you have forgotten the syntax of a for-loop in C++
  - you get a strange error in the command line when compiling or executing your program
- You google 
  - "for loop cpp"
  - or use the copy-pasted error message as a search string
- If the first three results don't offer what you are looking for, chances are you should refine your search string
  - e.g. "for loop cpp example syntax" or "range-based for loop cpp 17 example" 
  - try to remove all parts of the error message that are specific to your individual program
- If the search result is an answered question from a forum such as www.stackoverflow.com
  - First, read the code snippet from the first reply. Often, this is what you are looking for.
  - If it does not help you immediately, only then read the question etc. to get the context
- If the search result is an official code documentation, then you might want to look for *example code*. 
  - It is often easier to understand than a detailed theoretical documentation. 
  - You can directly copy-paste it into your own project and adapt it there according to your needs.
- It is common to have ~100 search queries on a day of coding.
