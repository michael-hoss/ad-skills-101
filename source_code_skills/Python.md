# Python

The syntax of Python ([Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))) is beginner-friendly, and some even call it pseudocode that actually runs.
Python has gained much popularity in the late 2010s due to the hype in machine learning, but it has been around already since 1991.

It combines the benefits of
- C++: Many Python libraries (e.g. [numpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy)) are actually written in C or C++ for speed and are included as so-called [Python bindings](https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/).
- MATLAB: easily manipulating matrices and plotting graphs is enabled through common libraries such as [numpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
- Bash/Shell: Python is also well suited for scripting.
